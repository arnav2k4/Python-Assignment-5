# Task 1
The python program creates a dictionary with Students' names as keys and their marks as values. When the user enters a student's name, the program fetches the marks of that student and displays it.
If the student's data, whose name is entered by the user, is not stored in the dictionary, the program produces an appropriate message.

# Task 2
The python program creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10 and extracts the first five elements and reverses them. It then prints the extracted list and the reversed extracted list.
